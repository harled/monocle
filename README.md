## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'monocle'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install monocle

To generate the migration and build the data model, run:

```base
rails generate monocle:authorization_exceptions
rails db:migrate
```

## Usage
Once you have Monocle loaded you can render any of its view components. For example, you could render the `Monocle::ControllersOverTimeComponent` with:

```erb
<%= render Monocle::ControllersOverTimeComponent.new(events: AuthorizationException.all) %>
```

With a full list of components here:

    <tr>
      <td>ControllersOverTimeComponent</td>
      <td>Shows the number of events over time.</td>
