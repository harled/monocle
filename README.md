ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§µ Using Pundit as a User Experience (UX) tool ü§µü§µ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A suite of [ViewComponents](https://github.com/github/view_component) for plug and play use right from your [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) exception data! Pundit is a popular authorization framework for Rails applications, but it has a hidden talent, UX! Moncale sits on Pundit's eye and provides insights of broken flows in your app leading to unauthorized responses.

This gem includes components for the following reports: **Add completed components here**
- Issue: https://github.com/harled/monocle/issues/1
- Issue: https://github.com/harled/monocle/issues/2
- Issue: https://github.com/harled/monocle/issues/5

This gem assumes:
- Data passed in is an ActiveRecordRelation queryable by
  - The time the exception occurred: `created_at: datetime`
  - The name of the controller in which the exception was called: `controller_name: string`
  - The name of the unauthorized action: `action_name: string`
- Bootstrap 5.1 is loaded in your project
  - It will work without Bootstrap, however, you will need to provide your own custom styling for several Bootstrap classes.
