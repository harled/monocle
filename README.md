Monocle is a suite of [ViewComponents](https://github.com/github/view_component) to provide insights to your Buy on Rails application based on authorization exceptions generated by [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit).

This information can help improve security and useability. You and your team will be surprised to see what you can learn from 401 Unauthorized!

## Dependencies
Monocle depends on the following libraries:

* [ViewComponent](https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* [Groupdate](https://github.com/ankane/groupdate)
* [ApexCharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apexcharts)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'monocle'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install monocle

To generate the migration and build the data model, run:

```base
rails generate monocle:authorization_exceptions
rails db:migrate
```

## Usage
Once you have Monocle loaded you can render any of its view components. For example, you could render the `Monocle::ControllersOverTimeComponent` with:

```erb
<%= render Monocle::ControllersOverTimeComponent.new(events: AuthorizationException.all) %>
```

With a full list of components here:
|Component|Purpose|
|---------|-------|
|ControllersOverTimeComponent|Shows the number of events over time.|
|HighestControllerActionCountComponent|Shows the controller endpoint which has caused the most authorization exceptions given the events passed in.|
|ExceptionsByControllerComponent|Shows the number of events grouped by controller name.
|ExceptionsByRequestComponent|Shows the number of events grouped by request.|
|ExceptionsByUserComponent|Shows the number of events grouped by user id.|
|ExceptionsSinceTimeAgoComponent|Shows the number of exceptions over a specified period of time and the percentage increase over time.|
|TopTenUsersComponent|Shows the top ten users in terms of who caused most authorization exceptions.|
|UsersAffectedSinceTimeAgoComponent|Shows the number of users affected over a given time period.|

For more information about each view component, including the method signature, look for the `.rb` files in the `app/components/monocle` directory.

## Development

Monocle development is made easy with vscode [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/). Once the repo has been checked out, open the project in a devcontainer and 
then open a new terminal.

```bash
# install required packages
bin/setup

# install spec/sample packages
bundle install --gemfile spec/sample/Gemfile

# run test cases and ensure everything is passing
rake spec

# an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment with monocle
bin/console
```

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 

### Sample Application

ViewComponents are pretty hard to test without a Ruby on Rails application. This repository includes a sample application that makes it easy to see how a component renders and make quick adjustments.

To use the sample application: 

```
# change directory to the sample project
cd spec/sample

# install packages (if not already done)
bundle install

# migrate the database
rails db:migrate

# seed data with mock exceptions
rails db:seed

# run the server
bundle exec rails server

# open your browser to localhost:3000
```


## Release

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
